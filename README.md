📊 Project Title: Netflix Content Insights Dashboard | Power BI
📝 Project Overview:
The Netflix Content Insights Dashboard is an interactive data visualization project designed to explore and analyze the global catalog of movies and TV shows available on Netflix. Using Microsoft Power BI, this project transforms raw data into visually compelling insights to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in streaming content across genres, countries, release years, and ratings.
The dashboard offers stakeholders a comprehensive view of how content is distributed, rated, and released, aiding in content strategy, regional performance analysis, and audience targeting.

🎯 Objectives:
To analyze the distribution and characteristics of Netflix content (movies vs. TV shows).
To identify the top contributing countries and genres in the Netflix catalog.
To examine rating patterns across content types and cast members.
To track release year trends and measure volatility over time.
To build an intuitive, visually appealing, and interactive dashboard for non-technical stakeholders.

📌 Key Insights Visualized:
📈 Content Breakdown by Type (Movies vs. TV Shows)
🌍 Geographical Distribution of content across countries
🗓 Release Year Trends & Volatility over time
🎭 Ratings Distribution by type, country, cast, and director\
🔠 Genre Distribution and most common content categories
👥 Cast & Director Contribution analytics

🧠 Skills Applied:
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Identified and handled missing/null values, standardized categorical data (e.g., genre, country), and parsed multi-value fields (e.g., cast and directors).
Data Modeling: Built relationships between different columns (e.g., country and content type) to enable seamless cross-filtering and aggregation.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted deep exploratory analysis to uncover patterns across content ratings, durations, and release periods.
Data Visualization: Created interactive visualizations using bar charts, pie charts, stacked columns, line graphs, and maps to enhance user understanding.
Dashboard Design: Focused on usability, clarity, and interactivity — ensuring end-users can filter by year, type, genre, country, or rating.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used:
🧰 Power BI Features:
Power Query Editor (for data cleaning & shaping)
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for custom metrics & measures
Slicers & filters for interactivity
Matrix and card visualizations
Custom visuals for enhanced user experience

📊 Data Source:
Netflix Dataset (CSV file) containing metadata of Netflix’s movies and TV shows including:
Title, Type, Country, Date Added, Release Year
Duration, Director, Cast, Genre (listed_in), Rating

🔢 Supporting Libraries (if done in Python preprocessing – optional):
Pandas: for data cleaning, merging multi-valued fields
NumPy: for numerical operations
Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional): for initial EDA (if done before Power BI)

💼 Outcomes:
Provided a clear understanding of Netflix’s content library based on type, region, and release year.
Identified popular genres and contributing countries to Netflix’s global content.
Revealed patterns in audience ratings across different types and demographics.
Delivered a visually intuitive dashboard that allows users to drill down into specific data segments with ease.

🔗 Optional Add-Ons (For Portfolio Use):
Embedded or linked live Power BI dashboard (via Power BI Service)
GitHub repo with raw dataset and .pbix file
PDF snapshots of visual insights with brief annotations
